## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
### ReinventDAO: Own Your Expertise, Unlock Its Value in a Trillion-Dollar Market <a name="unlock"></a>

**Empowering Individuals in a Knowledge-Driven Economy**

The world is undergoing a significant shift. Knowledge and expertise are becoming the most valuable assets for individuals and businesses. Reinvent DAO introduces the Composable Know-How Marketplace (CKM), a groundbreaking platform that empowers you to take control of your Knowledge Capital and transform it into a tradable intangible asset as Intellectual Property (IP) in a new internet era market.

**The Untapped Potential of Knowledge Capital**

* $61.9 Trillion: The estimated global value of intangible assets held by companies in 2023 ([Source](https://www.wipo.int/web/world-ip-report))
* $165 Billion: The global market size for IP licensing and branding in 2022 ( [Source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/))

These figures highlight the immense potential of intangible assets, a category dominated by Knowledge Capital. Yet, traditional methods often fail to capture the full value of expertise, leaving this vast resource underutilised.

### The Challenge: Fragmented Knowledge Market <a name="challenge"></a>
In today’s world, we know the current knowledge-sharing system is broken. Valuable skills become a challenge amongst professional white-collar in companies to get updated, and traditional methods like freelance work struggle to connect you with a broad enough audience and projects to maximize your income potential.

Whilst in Corporations; facing economic uncertainty, are hesitant to hire full-time - which risks containing valuable Know-How (or Intellectual Capital) within the companies. This, often in the form of crucial frameworks and toolkits, gets locked away in department libraries or dominated by Big Consulting Firms, hindering collaboration and innovation in the new open economic era.

The result? A fragmented marketplace where everyone loses. Professional White-Collar Individuals can't capitalize on their expertise, and businesses miss out on the very trendy know-how they need to thrive, especially in the critical field of Emerging Tech which is shaping the new internet economy in Web3.0 or Artificial intelligence (AI). This is where Reinvent DAO steps in, offering a new way forward.

### The Reinvent DAO Solution: The Composable Know-how Marketplace (CKM) <a name="solution"></a>
Reinvent DAO’s Composable Know-How Marketplace (CKM) empowers individuals by introducing Know-How as IP Assets.These Know-How as IP Assets represent white-collar professional creators' unique skills or know-how base and act as the building blocks within the marketplace. Each Know-How is composed of:

* **Pre-Fund from a Collection Sponsor:** Each Collection will have a Fund Sponsor to pre-fund the collection of the Emerging Tech IP Assets in exchange for the access to participate in Future performance of the IP assets collections.
* **Know-How as IP Asset:** Representing the Know-How as IP Asset itself and can be linked to existing credentials or newly minted for specific asset class per Collections. I.e. Digital Asset Management with multiple asset classes across Strategy/Risk/Marketing/Design/Operational.
* **Reputation Score on Profile:** Provides information about the creator's experience, certifications, and project history, allowing potential collaborators or clients to assess their reputation from previous and current contributions in the Reinvent DAO ecosystem.
* **Leasing Know-How:** The CKM utilizes various modules (Licensing and Royalty turned into % of Royalty between Creators, Consumers, and Sponsors)

### About Types in Traditional Know-How: Toolkits, Frameworks, Blueprints as Proprietary Assets <a name="framework"></a>
Toolkits, Best Practices, Frameworks, Blueprints, Research, and Methodologies are indispensable for Consultants in Big Firms as they promote efficiency, consistency, quality, collaboration, risk mitigation, brand reputation, and scalability. These resources empower consultants to leverage the collective knowledge and expertise within their own niche firm, deliver high-value solutions, and meet client expectations in a competitive consulting global landscape.

Example of a re-iterative Toolkit is The Five Forces Analysis framework which is a widely used tool in Strategic Consulting to assess the competitive dynamics of an industry. It helps identify the key factors that influence the profitability and attractiveness of an industry or business. 

### Market Opportunity: Innovation in a Rapidly Evolving World <a name="market"></a>
The relentless march of technological advancement demands a fundamental shift in how knowledge is shared. Currently, valuable expertise and methodologies – the "Know-how" and toolkits that drive progress – often reside within consulting firms as Intellectual Property. This siloed approach restricts their utilization, hindering innovation across the broader economy.

A staggering $62 trillion opportunity lies dormant in the under-capitalized value of intangible assets in firms globally, a category dominated by knowledge capital ([Source](https://www.wipo.int/web/world-ip-report)). This immense potential remains largely untapped due to the limitations of the fragmented knowledge marketplace. 

The global market size for IP licensing and branding, valued at $165 billion ([Source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/)), underscores the economic worth of these assets. However, traditional methods need to fully capture and disseminate this valuable knowledge.

The workforce in 2024 and the future is shifting. The rise of the gig economy, projected to reach $455.63 billion by 2030 ([Source](https://ResearchAndMarkets.com)), reflects a significant shift in the workforce. While offering flexibility, this trend needs to have the structure to fully harness the potential of individual Knowledge Capital, which is a form of Intellectual Property. 

This confluence of factors presents a compelling market opportunity. With the burgeoning freelance workforce and the vast, untapped potential of knowledge capital, a new approach to knowledge sharing is urgently needed. This is the driving force behind Reinvent DAO, a transformative solution to provide more accessibility for a knowledge-driven future.

### Example: Helping Businesses to Integrate Emerging Tech as Know-How, turning it into a Tradeable IP Asset <a name="example"></a>
Imagine you're an Independent Consultant or SME Consulting Firm with in-depth expertise in Digital Assets, especially in Payments integration with Stablecoins into businesses. Traditionally, finding clients and managing projects can be cumbersome. With Reinvent DAO’s CKM:

* Create a Knowledge IP Asset on Reinvent DAO’s CKM to highlight your expertise in Stablecoin subject matter, across -  Strategy, Risk Management, Design, and Commercialization.
* Get the Collections’ Sponsors to provide upfront capital: As the Sponsor provides upfront capital for the creators(you), the user gets % of the Royalty of the IP Assets of a collection upon the derivatives transactions from the IP Assets. 
* Collaborate with other creators on Reinvent DAO’s Know-How Marketplace who offer complementary skills to provide comprehensive solutions.

By transforming your knowledge into a tradable IP asset on Reinvent DAO’s Marketplace, you can:
* **Monetize Your Expertise:** Generate revenue by sharing your knowledge, and leasing the know-how to other businesses globally.
* **Reach a Wider Audience:** Showcase your expertise to a vast network of potential clients.
* **Be an Early Adopter:** Position yourself as a leader in an emerging tech field, specifically Digital Asset and Gen-AI processes. 

Reinvent DAO empowers you to take control of your knowledge capital, unlocking its true value in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

### Know-How in Today’s Business World <a name="know-how"></a>

### Pre-Fund of IP Know-How Collections <a name="pre-fund"></a>
Upon the introduction of the Know-How Collection, the interested parties such as Sponsors are able to pre-fund the Know-How for an upfront capital for the Creators to commence the Know-How creation work for tokenising their IP Asset work creation. 

The Collection Sponsors will be incentivised a % of IP Royalty of the leasing and collaboration of the IP Assets. This will be in exchange of the upfront pre-fund capital provided by the Early Believers as Sponsors.

## ReinventDAO Stack <a name="dao-stack"></a>

### Chain - EVM <a name="evm"></a>
Reinvent DAO is based on an EVM-compatible for L2 blockchain. 
The reason why we chose to build on an EVM-compatible chain is because such a choice would provide familiar tools, libraries and language like Solidity for us to build the Reinvent DAO stack. 

EVM chains are intended to solve Ethereum’s scalability issues, offering faster and more affordable transactions. Ethereum's limited throughput, measured in transactions per second (TPS), often leads to network congestion and high transaction fees during periods of heavy usage. 

Deploying on an EVM-compatible chain gives access to a wider audience of both developers and users who are already familiar with existing Ethereum applications and tools and makes the onboarding process easier.
### Storage - IPFS <a name="ipfs"></a>
Most of the Know-How Assets (toolkits) are stored encrypted on IPFS as a way to protect from unauthorized access, and we ensure the accessibility of the content is protected for the Licensor (Creator).
 
The IPFS hash(URL) is then stored on the blockchain for retrieval purposes. 

### DAO Structure <a name="structure"></a>

DAO Lifecycle <a name="lifecycle"></a>

In Reinvent DAO, we are running three DAO lifecycle stages. The decentralised organisational structure of a DAO will evolve from their structure and operations in stages. 


### Smart Contract for Know-How as IP Asset Tokenisation <a name="sc"></a>
This Litepaper explores a novel smart contract solution for tokenising Know-How as Intellectual Property (IP) assets. Here's how the solution will facilitate efficient and secure ownership.

#### Know-How as IP Tokenisation <a name="know-how-ip"></a> 
Creators submit detailed descriptions of the Know-How as IP asset, including Document Title, Collection Type, Asset Type, Author and others. 

IP Assets are the foundational RWA we’re building on our Composable Know-How Marketplace (CKM). 
Each IP Asset is an on-chain ERC-721 NFT (representing an IP), with ownership assigned to the creator or collaborator. This globally unique record as the IP Asset, and the original ERC-721 as the IP.

**Later Phase**

Licensing Terms will be based on licensing terms (usage rights, terms to lease, etc). Each NFT contains Know-How as IP Asset, which will represent a pre-defined Royalty stake in the IP when it’s minted, along with associated rights and terms. 

#### Know-How as IP Leasing <a name="leasing"></a> 

**Proportional Share of Royalties:**

When the IP is used (e.g. licensed, copyright used in a product), Know-How creators automatically receive a portion of the resulting revenue based on their NFT ownership.

The Smart Contract can be programmed to automatically distribute IP Royalties (in % of the IP Monetisation) or other benefits (e.g., licensing fees) to the Creators or Sponsors,  based on the pre-defined rules.

This ensures efficient and transparent revenue sharing, incentivizing investment in the IP asset.

#### Security & Compliance <a name="compliance"></a>
The Smart Contracts are built with robust security features like access controls and encryption to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity.

The Smart Contract can be designed to integrate with relevant regulatory frameworks, fostering trust amongst our community and investor confidence.

#### DAO Smart Contract Solution (Later Phase) <a name="sc-solution"></a>

As we progress towards decentralisation, the Smart Contract will be triggered to automate the Sub DAO and the Parent DAO operations. 

##### Parent DAO  <a name="parent-dao"></a>
The Parent DAO is the one that handles all operations within the DAO such as token Airdrops, members' reputation, creation of new Sub DAOs, and adding and removing members of the DAO. The Parent DAO contract will be deployed on the blockchain. It will also be responsible for setting the DAO Constitutions, Terms & Conditions for members, treasury management, liquidity pool, funds distribution, and voting.  

##### Sub-DAOs <a name="sub-dao"></a>

Every sub-DAO has its own Smart Contract (SC) that will communicate with the parentDAO SC.
A subDAO is part of Reinvent DAO, meaning its members must follow the Constitutions and Operational Rules set by the parentDAO. 

Once the DAO is in a fully decentralised lifecycle stage and SC has been executed to automate the operations, a subDAO can also decide to resolve and thus its treasury will be distributed to the parentDAO or spin-out and become its own independent DAO.

### Reinvent DAO Governance (Later Phase) <a name="governance"></a>
Reinvent DAO utilises $REIV as on selected decision-making processes related to the operations of the DAO once the business model is established and we start going into decentralisation or ‘DAO in Lifecycle’ transition. 

The members will be given voting rights based on active participation, Reputational Score and active activities contribution to Reinvent DAO’s ecosystem. 

Early Adopters (Early Creators/Consumers) will be incentivised now in REIV Points upon early GTM strategy to onboard early users and assets (Know-How as IP Assets) as Creators and Consumers.

More details at a later stage in the Full Whitepaper version.
### Reputation Score Model <a name="reputation"></a>
Each Reinvent DAO member will have a reputation score associated with their Decentralised Identity (DID). This reputation score will be calculated based on on two criteria as follows:

1. *Initial reputation score:* This value of the initial reputation score is defined based on the previous experience the consultants have from the creator’s LinkedIn profile, especially the member’s Seniority or number of years of experience. For example, someone with 10 years of experience will have a higher score when they first join compared to someone with 1 or 2 years of experience. 

2. *Contribution score:* This value is defined by the contribution of each consultant as part of the DAO, which means someone who contributed a lot as part of the DAO would have a higher reputation than someone who contributed less or didn’t contribute at all. We will assign weights to different types of contributions based on their importance.
For each member, calculate the contribution score using the weighted sum of their activities.

#### Reputation Calculation <a name="calculation"></a>
Sum the initial reputation and the contribution score  to get the total reputation 𝑅
Reinvent DAO leverages AI to assess and visualize the engagement and impact of DAO members based on their activities and contributions

### Algorithm for IP Valuation <a name="valuation"></a>
Reinvent DAO is developing an AI-driven algorithm to provide a valuation of IP as intangible assets within Reinvent DAO's Composable Know-how Marketplace, enhancing the reliability and precision of a range of valuations for IP Assets. 

The valuation criteria may include internal and external data, such as the members' reputation as creators in our ecosystem,  benchmarking on Future IP Royalty benefits and many others on the licensing from the consumer end. 

By combining and analyzing internal and external data, the algorithm can comprehensively evaluate the Know How as IP Asset within the Reinvent DAO ecosystem. This data includes market trends indicating the popularity and demand for similar Know-How asset types, industry benchmarks providing performance metrics from similar organisations, competitor analysis detailing offerings and performance of competing Know-How…etc.   

### $REIV Tokenomics & Funding <a name="tokenomics"></a>

The $REIV token will be launched to foster a sustainable and
decentralized ecosystem for the Knowledge Capital and IP industry. 

It will serve as the core REIV Access token and medium of exchange on On-Chain IP licensing, allowing users to access exclusive Emerging Tech Know-How Secret Recipe, be whitelisted for exclusive Collection pre-launch on the REIV CKM, utilise for core subscription, thus building a “proof of contribution” model to get incentivised based on rewards.
#### $REIV Token Total Supply <a name="total-supply"></a>

Reinvent DAO ecosystem runs on a utility token, $REIV, which is capped at a maximum supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens. Some tokens are reserved for ecosystem development, early adopters and development funds.

$REIV can be used for the following:
* **Subscription:** Users can pay a monthly subscription to gain access to
REIV CKM. Users can pay in $REIV, or, $USDT, US Dollars, which will
then be converted to $REIV.

* **Know-How as IP Asset Leasing:** Fans can use $REIV to lease excluding Emerging Teh secret recipes through REIV CKM.
* **Staking and Rewards:** Creators can stake $REIV to receive rewards in the form of
platform incentives and access to premier Know-How before publicly available for the public on MAINNET. 
* **Collection Sponsorship:** $REIV can be used to support the creation of Know-How Collections through pre-fund capital to the early creators. In return, sponsors can receive % in IP Royalty as an exchange of the upfront capital. 
* **Bidding:** $REIV can be used to bid from the Sponsors to get the early allocation slot to sponsor the IP Collection pre-launch. 
* **Advertisement placement:** $REIV can be used to place advertisements from partners/corporates and also the ability to do product offerings/services in REIV community.
* **Rewards:** $REIV holders will be eligible for rewards, such as access to events,
masterclasses, special Partner events and others, 

#### Token Burn Mechanism <a name="burn"></a>
To ensure the long-term value of $REIV, a percentage of transaction fees generated on the platform will be used to permanently remove $REIV tokens from circulation through periodic burns. This fosters a sustainable supply of $REIV and incentivizes its long-term use.

#### Allocation of REIV Points <a name="points"></a>
All members who signed up to our platform as Early Adopter on Limited Campaign period AND have active participation are entitled to be incentivised with REIV Points.
The Creators will be incentivized with REIV Points as the Know-How been tokenised and APPROVED on the Marketplace. 

Members who refers Members will also be incentivised with REIV Points upon member sign up, and ability to get reward with high value REIV Points upon creation of their Know-How, that is being tokenised. 

At a later phase, REIV Points can be converted into digital currencies once the $REIV Token Launch occurs.

#### Token Allocation $REIV <a name="allocation"></a>

REIV ERC-20 tokens minted will automatically be allocated to REIV’s Liquidity Pool. 
The monetisation paid by the consumers to subscribe to the Know-How, paid in Fiat ($USD) or Stablecoin (USDC) or $REIV token will be paid towards the REIV Liquidity Pool.
An allocated ratio of 70:30 between the Asset Owner and CKM platform will be allocated according to the leasing fees of the IP Assets.
