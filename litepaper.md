## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
### ReinventDAO: Own Your Expertise, Unlock Its Value in a Trillion-Dollar Market <a name="unlock"></a>

**Empowering Individuals in a Knowledge-Driven Economy**

The world is undergoing a significant shift. Knowledge and expertise are becoming the most valuable assets for individuals and businesses. Reinvent DAO introduces the Composable Know-How Marketplace (CKM), a groundbreaking platform that empowers you to take control of your Knowledge Capital and transform it into a tradable intangible asset as Intellectual Property (IP) in a new internet era market.

**The Untapped Potential of Knowledge Capital**

* $61.9 Trillion: The estimated global value of intangible assets held by companies in 2023 ([Source](https://www.wipo.int/web/world-ip-report))
* $165 Billion: The global market size for IP licensing and branding in 2022 ( [Source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/))

These figures highlight the immense potential of intangible assets, a category dominated by Knowledge Capital. Yet, traditional methods often fail to capture the full value of expertise, leaving this vast resource underutilised.

### The Challenge: Fragmented Knowledge Market <a name="challenge"></a>
In today’s world, we know the current knowledge-sharing system is broken. Valuable skills become a challenge amongst professional white-collar in companies to get updated, and traditional methods like freelance work struggle to connect you with a broad enough audience and projects to maximize your income potential.

Whilst in Corporations; facing economic uncertainty, are hesitant to hire full-time - which risks containing valuable Know-How (or Intellectual Capital) within the companies. This, often in the form of crucial frameworks and toolkits, gets locked away in department libraries or dominated by Big Consulting Firms, hindering collaboration and innovation in the new open economic era.

The result? A fragmented marketplace where everyone loses. Professional White-Collar Individuals can't capitalize on their expertise, and businesses miss out on the very trendy know-how they need to thrive, especially in the critical field of Emerging Tech which is shaping the new internet economy in Web3.0 or Artificial intelligence (AI). This is where Reinvent DAO steps in, offering a new way forward.

### The Reinvent DAO Solution: The Composable Know-how Marketplace (CKM) <a name="solution"></a>
Reinvent DAO’s Composable Know-How Marketplace (CKM) empowers individuals by introducing Know-How as IP Assets.These Know-How as IP Assets represent white-collar professional creators' unique skills or know-how base and act as the building blocks within the marketplace. Each Know-How is composed of:

* **Pre-Fund from a Collection Sponsor:** Each Collection will have a Fund Sponsor to pre-fund the collection of the Emerging Tech IP Assets in exchange for the access to participate in Future performance of the IP assets collections.
* **Know-How as IP Asset:** Representing the Know-How as IP Asset itself and can be linked to existing credentials or newly minted for specific asset class per Collections. I.e. Digital Asset Management with multiple asset classes across Strategy/Risk/Marketing/Design/Operational.
* **Reputation Score on Profile:** Provides information about the creator's experience, certifications, and project history, allowing potential collaborators or clients to assess their reputation from previous and current contributions in the Reinvent DAO ecosystem.
* **Leasing Know-How:** The CKM utilizes various modules (Licensing and Royalty turned into % of Royalty between Creators, Consumers, and Sponsors)

### About Types in Traditional Know-How: Toolkits, Frameworks, Blueprints as Proprietary Assets <a name="framework"></a>
Toolkits, Best Practices, Frameworks, Blueprints, Research, and Methodologies are indispensable for Consultants in Big Firms as they promote efficiency, consistency, quality, collaboration, risk mitigation, brand reputation, and scalability. These resources empower consultants to leverage the collective knowledge and expertise within their own niche firm, deliver high-value solutions, and meet client expectations in a competitive consulting global landscape.

Example of a re-iterative Toolkit is The Five Forces Analysis framework which is a widely used tool in Strategic Consulting to assess the competitive dynamics of an industry. It helps identify the key factors that influence the profitability and attractiveness of an industry or business. 

### Market Opportunity: Innovation in a Rapidly Evolving World <a name="market"></a>
The relentless march of technological advancement demands a fundamental shift in how knowledge is shared. Currently, valuable expertise and methodologies – the "Know-how" and toolkits that drive progress – often reside within consulting firms as Intellectual Property. This siloed approach restricts their utilization, hindering innovation across the broader economy.

A staggering $62 trillion opportunity lies dormant in the under-capitalized value of intangible assets in firms globally, a category dominated by knowledge capital ([Source](https://www.wipo.int/web/world-ip-report)). This immense potential remains largely untapped due to the limitations of the fragmented knowledge marketplace. 

The global market size for IP licensing and branding, valued at $165 billion ([Source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/)), underscores the economic worth of these assets. However, traditional methods need to fully capture and disseminate this valuable knowledge.

The workforce in 2024 and the future is shifting. The rise of the gig economy, projected to reach $455.63 billion by 2030 ([Source](https://ResearchAndMarkets.com)), reflects a significant shift in the workforce. While offering flexibility, this trend needs to have the structure to fully harness the potential of individual Knowledge Capital, which is a form of Intellectual Property. 

This confluence of factors presents a compelling market opportunity. With the burgeoning freelance workforce and the vast, untapped potential of knowledge capital, a new approach to knowledge sharing is urgently needed. This is the driving force behind Reinvent DAO, a transformative solution to provide more accessibility for a knowledge-driven future.

### Example: Helping Businesses to Integrate Emerging Tech as Know-How, turning it into a Tradeable IP Asset <a name="example"></a>
Imagine you're an Independent Consultant or SME Consulting Firm with in-depth expertise in Digital Assets, especially in Payments integration with Stablecoins into businesses. Traditionally, finding clients and managing projects can be cumbersome. With Reinvent DAO’s CKM:

* Create a Knowledge IP Asset on Reinvent DAO’s CKM to highlight your expertise in Stablecoin subject matter, across -  Strategy, Risk Management, Design, and Commercialization.
* Get the Collections’ Sponsors to provide upfront capital: As the Sponsor provides upfront capital for the creators(you), the user gets % of the Royalty of the IP Assets of a collection upon the derivatives transactions from the IP Assets. 
* Collaborate with other creators on Reinvent DAO’s Know-How Marketplace who offer complementary skills to provide comprehensive solutions.

By transforming your knowledge into a tradable IP asset on Reinvent DAO’s Marketplace, you can:
* **Monetize Your Expertise:** Generate revenue by sharing your knowledge, and leasing the know-how to other businesses globally.
* **Reach a Wider Audience:** Showcase your expertise to a vast network of potential clients.
* **Be an Early Adopter:** Position yourself as a leader in an emerging tech field, specifically Digital Asset and Gen-AI processes. 

Reinvent DAO empowers you to take control of your knowledge capital, unlocking its true value in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

### Know-How in Today’s Business World <a name="know-how"></a>

### Pre-Fund of IP Know-How Collections <a name="pre-fund"></a>
Upon the introduction of the Know-How Collection, the interested parties such as Sponsors are able to pre-fund the Know-How for an upfront capital for the Creators to commence the Know-How creation work for tokenising their IP Asset work creation. 

The Collection Sponsors will be incentivised a % of IP Royalty of the leasing and collaboration of the IP Assets. This will be in exchange of the upfront pre-fund capital provided by the Early Believers as Sponsors.
